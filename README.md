# AnnounceResult
This is the announce result service for my FYP. It is written in Java. It uses a 0mq binding.
It is responsible for announcing the result of the auction.

## Project Setup

Requires Firebase integration.

## License

None

## Setting up AnnounceResult service on AWS

- Created AWS EC2 Windows instance
- Connected with RDP and .pem keyfile
- Copied Service build to instance
- Configure Windows Firewall to allow port access for 0mq

- Service runs and works as expected
